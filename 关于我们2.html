  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <h3>The Best Science for Better life</h3>
     <p>
        The Lancet began as an independent, international weekly general medical journal founded in 1823 by Thomas Wakley. Since its first issue (October 5, 1823), the journal has strived to make science widely available so that medicine can serve, and transform society, and positively impact the lives of people.
     </p>
     <p>
        Over the past two centuries, The Lancet has sought to address urgent topics in our society, initiate debate, put science into context, and influence decision makers around the world.
     </p>
     <p>
        The Lancet has evolved as a family of journals (across Child & Adolescent Health, Diabetes & Endocrinology, Digital Health, Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Global Health, Haematology, Healthy Longevity, HIV, Infectious Diseases, Neurology, Oncology, Planetary Health, Psychiatry, Public Health, Respiratory Medicine, Biomedicine, Clinical Medicine), but retains at its core the belief that medicine must serve society, that knowledge must transform society, that the best science must lead to better lives.
     </p>
   <h3>Our Manifesto</h3>
     <p>
         <h4>Highest standards for medical science</h4>
         <p>
           The Lancet sets extremely high standards. We select only the best research papers for their quality of work and the progression they bring.
         </p>
         <h4>Improving lives is the only end goal</h4>
         <p>
           Too much research is done for research’s sake. We believe that improving lives is the only end goal and that research is only relevant when it has impact on human lives.
         </p>
         <h4>Increasing the social impact of science</h4>
         <p>
           We recognise that a great research paper is not enough and that it requires development, mobilisation, and exposure. So we promise to set agendas, create context, inform leaders, start debates, and advocate for the idea that research can and will make a difference.
